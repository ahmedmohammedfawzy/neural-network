# Neural Network from Scratch in C++

This project implements a simple feedforward neural network in C++ with basic functionalities such as dense layers, activation functions (ReLU, Softmax), and categorical cross-entropy loss. It generates synthetic datasets and trains a small neural network on them.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- C++ standard library

## Usage
Clone the repository and compile the program:

```sh
$ g++ -o neural_net main.cpp -std=c++11
$ ./neural_net
```
